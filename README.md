## **Project Title: Apple iPhone Sales Analysis**

### **Description**

This project provides an analysis of Apple iPhone sales data, using a dataset of Apple products from Flipkart. The primary goal is to explore the relationships between different product attributes like price, ratings, and discounts. The analysis is performed using Python and popular data visualization libraries to uncover insights and trends in the iPhone market in India.

### **DataSource**
`apple_products.csv`

### **Key Features**

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The notebook begins with loading the data, checking for missing values, and generating descriptive statistics to understand the dataset's basic characteristics.
* **Top-Rated iPhones:** The analysis identifies and lists the top 10 highest-rated iPhone models based on their star ratings.
* **Discount vs. Ratings Analysis:** A scatter plot with a trendline is created to visualize the relationship between the discount percentage and the number of ratings for various iPhone models. This helps in understanding if discounts correlate with higher customer ratings.

### **Technologies Used**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly
